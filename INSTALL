The following is a brief overview of the building and installing instructions for debian / ubuntu.

For full instructions on how to build and install Motion, see the motion_guide.html that is
distributed with this source code. The guide also includes instructions for building Motion
on distributions other than debian/ubuntu such as BSD, Mac and Centos.

The packages and library names change frequently and vary across base operating systems.
Adjust the following lines as required by the base operating system.

Install basic build packages:
    sudo apt-get install autoconf automake pkgconf libtool libjpeg8-dev build-essential libzip-dev

Install FFMPEG packages
    sudo apt-get install libavformat-dev libavcodec-dev libavutil-dev libswscale-dev libavdevice-dev

Once required packages are installed, execute:
    autoreconf -fiv
    ./configure
    make
    make install

Sample custom configuration options:
    --prefix               :  Specify the install location for the motion package
    --with-ffmpeg=[dir]    :  Specify the location in which ffmpeg/libav is installed.
