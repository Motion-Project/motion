The following is a brief overview of the building and installing instructions.

For full instructions on how to build and install Motion, see the 
motion_guide.html that is distributed with this source code.

The building instructions vary based upon the base system and the desired options.
For most installs, it will be desired to include either ffmpeg or libav and these will
have associated dependencies which dictate the configuration options. 

Build Packages:
    autoconf 
    automake
    git
    pkgconf
    libtool 
    libjpeg8-dev 
    build-essential 
    libzip-dev

The option to include FFMPEG or Libav functionality in motion is a choice of one OR the other not both.
The packages and library names change frequently and vary across base operating systems.  If ffmpeg or
libav are built and installed from source the custom motion configuration options will usually be needed.

FFMPEG Packages
    ffmpeg
    libavformat-dev 
    libavcodec-dev 
    libavutil-dev 
    libswscale-dev
    
Libav Packages
    libavformat-dev 
    libavcodec-dev 
    libavutil-dev 
    libav-tools 
    libswscale-dev

Once required packages are installed, execute:
    autoreconf -fiv
    ./configure
    make
    make install

Sample custom configuration options:
    --prefix               :  Specify the install location for the motion package
    --with-ffmpeg=[dir]    :  Specify the location in which ffmpeg/libav is installed.
