/**
 * netcam_read_html_jpeg
 *
 * This routine reads a jpeg image from the netcam.  When it is called,
 * the stream is already positioned just after the image header.
 *
 * This routine is called under the four variations of two different
 * conditions:
 *     1) Streaming or non-streaming camera
 *           Note: Keep-Alive is supported for non-streaming cameras,
 *           if enabled in the netcam's config structure.
 *     2) Header does or does not include Content-Length
 * Additionally, if it is a streaming camera, there must always be a
 * boundary-string.
 *
 * The routine will (attempt to) read the JPEG image.  If a Content-Length
 * is present, it will be used (this will result in more efficient code, and
 * also code which should be better at detecting and recovering from possible
 * error conditions).
 *
 * If a boundary-string is present (and, if the camera is streaming, this
 * *must* be the case), the routine will assure that it is recognized and
 * acted upon.
 *
 * Our algorithm for this will be as follows:
 *     1) If a Content-Length is present, set the variable "remaining"
 *        to be equal to that value, else set it to a "very large"
 *        number.
 *        WARNING !!! Content-Length *must* to be greater than 0, even more
 *        a jpeg image cannot be less than 300 bytes or so.
 *     2) While there is more data available from the camera:
 *        a) If there is a "boundary string" specified (from the initial
 *           header):
 *           i)   If the amount of data in the input buffer is less than
 *                the length of the boundary string, get more data into
 *                the input buffer (error if failure).
 *           ii)  If the boundary string is found, check how many
 *                characters remain in the input buffer before the start
 *                of the boundary string.  If that is less than the
 *                variable "remaining", reset "remaining" to be equal
 *                to that number.
 *        b) Try to copy up to "remaining" characters from the input
 *           buffer into our destination buffer.
 *        c) If there are no more characters available from the camera,
 *           exit this loop, else subtract the number of characters
 *           actually copied from the variable "remaining".
 *     3) If Content-Length was present, and "remaining" is not equal
 *        to zero, generate a warning message for logging.
 *
 *
 * Parameters:
 *      netcam          Pointer to netcam context
 *
 *
 * Returns:             0 for success, -1 for error

/**
 * netcam_read_mjpg_jpeg
 *
 *     This routine reads from a netcam using a MJPG-chunk based
 *     protocol, used by Linksys WVC200 for example.
 *     This implementation has been made by reverse-engineering
 *     the protocol, so it may contain bugs and should be considered as
 *     experimental.
 *
 * Protocol explanation:
 *
 *     The stream consists of JPG pictures, spanned across multiple
 *     MJPG chunks (in general 3 chunks, altough that's not guaranteed).
 *
 *     Each data chunk can range from 1 to 65535 bytes + a header, altough
 *     i have not seen anything bigger than 20000 bytes + a header.
 *
 *     One MJPG chunk is constituted by a header plus the chunk data.
 *     The chunk header is of fixed size, and the following data size
 *     and position in the frame is specified in the chunk header.
 *
 *     From what i have seen on WVC200 cameras, the stream always begins
 *     on JPG frame boundary, so you don't have to worry about beginning
 *     in the middle of a frame.
 *
 *     See netcam.h for the mjpg_header structure and more details.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *      netcam          Pointer to a netcam_context structure
 *
 * Returns:             0 if an image was obtained from the camera,
 *                      or -1 if an error occurred.
