# To tune restart behaviour, see systemd.unit(5) and use
# "systemctl edit motion" to change the following settings:
#StartLimitBurst=
#StartLimitIntervalSec=
#StartLimitAction=
#FailureAction=
# The following can be used to increase the security of the
# installation, by mitigating risk from attacks on motion and the
# binaries, libraries and scripts which it relies on.  They are disabled
# by default in case they break existing installations, e.g. those which
# call site-local scripts which would inherit the same restrictions.
#
# See systemd.exec(5) and
# http://0pointer.net/public/systemd-nluug-2014.pdf for more details
# of these and other related options.
#
# Use "systemctl edit motion" to change these settings.
