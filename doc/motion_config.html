    <h2><a name="Basic_Setup"></a>  Basic Setup </h2>
    <ul>
      <p></p>
      Motion is able to process images from many different types of cameras.  The following is brief overview
      of the process to set up the Motion software.
      <ul>
        <li>Determine the type of camera
        <ul>
          <li> <a href="#basic_setup_v4l2" >v4l2 devices</a> which are most webcams</li>
          <li> <a href="#basic_setup_composite" >Composite capture cards</a> </li>
          <li> <a href="#basic_setup_network" >Network or IP cameras</a> </li>
          <li> <a href="#basic_setup_picam" >The PI camera</a> </li>
          <li> <a href="#basic_setup_static" >Static movie files</a>.
        </ul>
        <li>Specify the camera in the <a href="#configfiles" >configuration files</a>.</li>
        <li>Start Motion from a terminal via the <a href="#commandlineoptions" >command line</a></li>
        <li>Review the messages to ensure camera was found and press cntrl-c to exit</li>
        <li>Specify a <a href="#target_dir" >target_dir</a> in the configuration file.</li>
        <li>Enable the <a href="#OptDetail_Stream" >web stream</a> in the configuration file </li>
        <ul>
          <li> Specify a <a href="#stream_port" >stream_port</a></li>
          <li> Optionally turn off <a href="#stream_localhost" >stream_localhost</a> if you want to view
               the stream from a different computer</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Enable the <a href="#OptDetail_Webcontrol" >web control</a> in the configuration file </li>
        <ul>
          <li> Specify a <a href="#webcontrol_port" >webcontrol_port</a></li>
          <li> Optionally turn off <a href="#webcontrol_localhost" >webcontrol_localhost</a> if you want to view
               the webcontrol from a different computer</li>
          <li> Specify which parameters to show on the webcontrol via <a href="#webcontrol_parms" >webcontrol_parms</a></li>
          <li> Optionally specify a <a href="#stream_preview_method" >stream_preview_method</a></li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      The above should allow users to get Motion running and being able to view images via the stream.  The
      next steps refine and finish a basic setup.
      <ul>
          <li> Refine how the image is captured with the <a href="#OptTopic_Image_Processing" >image processing</a> parameters</li>
          <li> Specify the <a href="#OptTopic_Motion_Detection" >motion detection</a> parameters</li>
          <li>
            <a href="#OptTopic_Scripts" >Execute scripts</a>, Save
            <a href="#OptTopic_Pictures" >pictures</a> or
            <a href="#OptTopic_Movies" >movies</a>.
          </li>
      </ul>
      The most difficult step in the above process will be the motion detection settings and specifying them
      to minimize the false positives.  To assist this process, Motion provides the
      <a href="#stream_preview_method" >stream_preview_method</a> option 3 which allows users to see side
      by side images of where the motion is occurring next to the regular image.
      <ul>
        <li> Specify <a href="#stream_preview_method" >stream_preview_method 3</a></li>
        <li> Specify <a href="#webcontrol_parms" >webcontrol_parms 2</a> </li>
        <li> Start Motion and in a web browser navigate to the webcontrol port</li>
        <li> Try adjusting the
          <a href="#threshold" >threshold</a>,
          <a href="#noise_level" >noise_level</a>,
          <a href="#despeckle_filter" >despeckle_filter</a> and
          <a href="#smart_mask_speed" >smart_mask_speed</a>
        </li>
        <li> Make sure to write configuration to file in order to save any changes.</li>
      </ul>
      Motion also includes a <a href="#setup_mode" >setup_mode</a> which provides more values reported
      on the motion images and in the log to assist the setup.
      <p></p>
      The following are some additional topics which may be of interest during the initial setup.
      <ul>
        <li>Run automatically at start (Run as <a href="#basic_setup_service" >service</a>)</li>
        <li>Remove depreciated parameters warnings (<a href="#config_depreciated" >Remove Depreciated</a>)</li>
        <li>List/include all possible configuration parameters (<a href="#config_listall" >All parameters</a>)</li>
      </ul>
      <p></p>
      <a name="basic_setup_v4l2"></a>
      <strong>Video4linux devices</strong> must be installed per the requirements of the camera.  It is
      out of the scope of this document to tell you how to do this and it depends on which type of camera.  Once
      the camera is installed it will have the device name(s) of /dev/video0, /dev/video1, /dev/video2...
      <p></p>
      FreeBSD has a different naming scheme for pci devices that use the bktr subsystem.  The bktr subsystem will report
      devices using a naming scheme of /dev/bktr0, /dev/bktr1, etc.  These device may also need to use the other
      special device for the tuner.  The tuner will need to be specified with the tunerdevice option as /dev/tuner0.
      <p></p>
      USB cameras take a lot of bandwidth. A USB camera connected to a USB2 port or hub consumes virtually
      all the bandwidth that the port can handle. Even with a small framesize and low framerate you should not expect to have
      more than one camera per USB controller. If you need more than one USB camera it is possible to add extra USB PCI cards
      to your computer.  It is also possible that your computer has more than one controller for different USB slots.  For
      example, if the computer has six USB ports, the three on the left may be on controller A versus the three on the right
      may be on controller B.  In this situation, connecting two cameras to ports only on the left would not work due to
      excessive bandwidth.  However connecting one camera to port on the right and the other to the port on the left
      may work since they are on different controllers.

      <p></p>
      Motion permits the use of video cards that have discreet input channels.  Since USB cameras do not have input channels,
      the option <a href="#input" >input</a> must be set to the value -1 for USB cameras.
      <p></p>

      <a name="basic_setup_network"></a>
      <strong>Network cameras</strong> are set up via the
      <a href="#netcam_url" >netcam_url</a> parameter.
      The latest versions of Motion support rtsp format which many cameras now stream.  Some users have requested
      a list of the network cameras that will work with Motion.  Since Motion can now process RTSP streams, almost
      all cameras are supported.  Simply review the specifications of the camera and validate that
      RTSP or RTMP is listed. The cameras that will not work are those specifically sold to be integrated into
      proprietary software monitoring systems.  When determining cameras, consider carefully before selecting a
      wireless camera.  Cameras require a solid consistent signal and use a lot of bandwidth.   Inconsistencies in
      the wireless signal can result in a poor user experience so the use of a hardwired camera is recommended.
      <p></p>
      The URL connection string to enter is specific to the camera and is
      usually provided by the manufacturer.  The connection string is the same as what would be used by other
      video playing software such as VLC.  If the camera does not stream via RTSP and instead uses a MJPEG, then Motion
      can also view that format.  See the option <a href="#netcam_url" >netcam_url</a> for
      additional options.
      <p></p>

      <a name="basic_setup_picam"></a>
      <strong>Raspberry Pi cameras</strong> can be set up two different ways.  If Motion is installed by using the
      apt packages (e.g. apt-get install motion), then the camera must be set up using the bcm2835-v4l2 module which creates
      a v4l2 device for the camera.  Users will need to install this module using the
      command <code>sudo modprobe bcm2835-v4l2</code>.  This
      will set up the camera as a normal v4l2 device and it can be accessed via a standard /dev/videoX device.  If Motion is
      built from source or installed via the deb packages on the project release page, then an additional option is to set
      up the camera using the <a href="#mmalcam_name" >mmalcam_name</a> parameter or using
      the bcm2835-v4l2 module.  <strong>When Motion is installed via apt, the mmalcam option is not available.</strong>
      <p></p>

      <a name="basic_setup_composite"></a>
      <strong>Composite video cards</strong> are normally made with a chip called BT878 (older cards have a BT848). They
      all use the Linux driver called 'bttv'.
      <p></p>
      There are cards with more then one video input but still only one BT878 chip. They have a video multiplexer which
      input is selected with the config option <a href="#input" >input</a>. Input channel numbers start at 0
      (which is why the value -1 and not 0 disables input selection). There are video capture cards available
      with 4 or 8 inputs but only one chip. They present themselves as one single video device and
      you select input using the 'input' option. If you define e.g. 4 camera config files with the
      same video device name but different input numbers Motion automatically
      goes into round robin mode.
      <p></p>
      Many TV tuner cards have the input channels: TV Tuner = 0, Standard composite video = 1, S-VHS = 3.
      Others have TV=0, composite video 1= 1, composite video = 2,  S-VHS = 3.
      For video capture cards input 1 is normally the composite video input.
      <p></p>
      Some capture cards are specially made for surveillance with for example 4 inputs.
      Others have a TV tuner, a composite input and perhaps also a S-Video input.
      For all these cards the inputs are numbered. The numbering varies from card to card so the easiest
      is to experiment with a program such as VLC that can show the video stream.
      <p></p>
      If you use the TV tuner input you also need to set the frequency of the TV channel using the
      option <a href="#frequency" >frequency</a>. Otherwise
      set <a href="#frequency" >frequency</a> to 0.
      <p></p>
      Finally you need to set the TV <a href="#norm" >norm</a>.
      Values: 0 (PAL), 1 (NTSC), 2 (SECAM), 3 (PAL NC no colour). Default is 0 (PAL).
      If your camera is a PAL black and white you may get a better result with norm=3 (PAL no colour).
      <p></p>

      <a name="basic_setup_static"></a>
      <strong>Static files</strong> can also be processed by Motion in one of two ways.  The first method
      is by using the <a href="#netcam_url" >netcam_url</a> option and using a prefix of file:\\.  With
      this method, Motion will process the file at the speed specified by
      <a href="#framerate" >framerate</a>.  This allows the user to either speed up or slow down the video
      processing to suit the particular need.
      <p></p>
      The second option for processing a static file requires a bit of additional setup and uses a
      v4l2loopback device.  To set this up, first install the loopback software as described in the
      <a href="#OptDetail_Pipe" >Output - Pipe Options</a>
      section of this guide to create a /dev/videoX device and then use software such as ffmpeg to stream
      the static file into the v4l2 device.  e.g.
      <code> ffmpeg -re -i mymovie.mp4 -f v4l2 /dev/video0 </code>  Then in a separate terminal, start Motion
      with it set to use the <code>/dev/video0</code> device as input.  This method can can also be used to
      reformat the content to a different format.  The following outputs the original movie into a gray pixel format.
      <code> ffmpeg -re -i mymovie.mp4 -f v4l2 -pix_fmt gray /dev/video0 </code>
      This can be helpful as a interim process where ffmpeg supports a particular input but that format is not yet supported
      by Motion.

      <p></p>
      <a name="basic_setup_service"></a>
      <strong>Run as Service</strong>
      <p></p>
      The following instructions are only applicable to Debian and Ubuntu based systems.  For other distributions, users
      should consult their distribution documentation and provide pull requests to the Motion developers so that this
      section can be updated with their distribution.
      <p></p>
      Motion can be set up to run as a service which means that it will start automatically whenever the computer
      is started.  When Motion is installed from apt or from a deb file, default files are installed which can be
      easily modified so that Motion starts as a service.  If Motion is built directly from source and installed,
      then these additional files will need to be copied, modified and installed manually from the source and packaging
      repositories.
      <p></p>
      When setting up Motion to run as a service, it should be done only after all the other configuration
      has been completed.  It is much easier to edit and revise the parameters when Motion is just running
      in a terminal rather than as a service.
      <p></p>
      To set up to run as a service, first edit the file <code>/etc/default/motion</code> and revise the line
      to indicate <code>start_motion_daemon=yes</code>.
      Next, edit the main motion.conf file and specify <a href="#daemon" >daemon</a> as <code>on</code>
      When the computer is restarted, Motion should now be running.  The following commands control
      the Motion service.
      <ul>
        <li>Start the Motion service<code>sudo service motion start</code></li>
        <li>Stop the Motion service<code>sudo service motion stop</code></li>
        <li>Restart the Motion service<code>sudo service motion restart</code></li>
      </ul>
      <p></p>
      When running as a service, Motion runs as the user <code>motion</code> and this user is automatically
      added to the user group of <code>video</code>.  By only be included in this user group, when Motion is
      run, it will only have limited permissions.  It is NOT recommended that this user get added to the
      <code>sudo</code> group.  Instead, only add this user to groups that are specifically required.
      <p></p>
      On newer distributions, the above method of running a service is depreciated (but still functional) in
      favor of the systemctl method.  Since this is not available on all the distributions which Motion is
      deployed, the above method is retained.  Once systemctl is available on all the deployed versions, Motion
      will transition to systemctl as the service method.  For users that wish to systemctl rather than the above
      method, a <code>motion.system</code> file is included in the source code.
      <p></p>
      For users that are building and installing from source without a deb file, the file <code>motion.init-Debian</code>
      will need to be copied from the examples directory or from the source directory.  It will need to be renamed and put
      into <code>/etc/init.d/motion</code>.  Ensure that it is also marked as executable and has root ownership.  Next,
      create the file <code>/etc/default/motion</code> with the entry as specified above.  Finally, create the
      <code>motion</code> user as needed.  The scripts that create the groups and users when using
      the deb packages can be used as a model.  These scripts can be reviewed in the motion-packaging repo, within the
      debian directory, motion.postinst (e.g. <code>motion-packaging/debian/motion.postinst</code>

    </ul>

    <h2><a name="configfiles"></a>  The Configuration Files </h2>
    <ul>
      <p></p>
      If Motion was invoked with command line option <code>-c pathname</code> Motion will expect the config file to
      be as specified. When you specify the config file on the command line with -c you can call it anything.

      <p></p>
      If you do not specify -c or the filename you give Motion does not exist, Motion will search for the
      configuration file called 'motion.conf' in the following order:

      <p></p>
      <ol>
        <li> Current directory from where motion was invoked</li>
        <li> Then in a directory called '.motion' in the current users home directory (shell environment
          variable $HOME). E.g. /home/goofy/.motion/motion.conf</li>
        <li> The directory defined by the --sysconfdir=DIR when running .configure during installation of
          Motion<br />(If this option was not defined the default is /etc/motion)</li>
      </ol>
      If you have write access to /usr/local/etc/motion then the editor recommends having only one motion.conf file
      in the default /usr/local/etc/motion directory.

      <p></p>
      Motion has a configuration file in the distribution package called motion-dist.conf. When you run 'make install' this
      file gets copied to the /usr/local/etc/motion directory.

      <p></p>
      The configuration file needs to be renamed from motion-dist.conf to motion.conf. The original file is called
      motion-dist.conf so that your working motion.conf file does not accidentally get overwritten when
      you re-install or upgrade to a newer version of Motion.

      <p></p>
      If you have more than one camera you should not try and invoke Motion more times. Motion is made to work with
      more than one camera at the same time.  The motion.conf file establishes global parameters that apply to all
      cameras and separate camera.conf files that specify the parameters that apply to
      each specific camera.  The camera.conf files are specified at the bottom of the motion.conf file.  If you only
      have one camera you only need the motion.conf file but if you have more than one camera, then you will
      need to have
      <strong>one camera config file per camera</strong> plus the motion.conf file.

      <p></p>
      If you have for example two cameras you need motion.conf
      <strong>and two</strong> camera config files. So a total of <strong>three</strong> config files.

      <p></p>
      An option that is common to all cameras can be placed in motion.conf. (You can also put all parameters in the
      camera files but that makes a lot of editing when you change a common thing).

      <p></p>
      An option that is unique to a camera must be specified in each camera file.

      <p></p>
      The first camera is defined in the first camera file called from motion.conf. The 2nd camera is defined in the
      2nd camera file called from motion.conf etc.

      <p></p>
      Any option defined in motion.conf will be used for all cameras except for the cameras in which the same option
      is defined in a camera config file.

      <p></p>
      To make it clear, the camera files format and syntax is the same as motion.conf. An example of what you might want
      in a camera file as follows: assume you have two cameras, attached to one system. Create files camera0.conf and
      camera1.conf. At the end of motion.conf, uncomment out the lines that refer to them. The full contents of the
      camera files can be as simple as
      <p></p>
      <p></p>
        camera0.conf:
        <br /><code> videodevice /dev/video0</code>
      <p></p>
      <p></p>
        camera1.conf:
        <br /><code> videodevice /dev/video1</code>
      <p></p>
      <p></p>
      <p></p>
      Motion reads its configuration parameters in the following sequence. If the same
      parameter exists more than one place <strong>the last one read wins</strong>
      <ol>
        <li> Motion reads the configuration file motion.conf from the beginning of the file going down line by line.</li>
        <li> If the option "camera" is defined in motion.conf, the camera configuration file(s) is/(are) read.</li>
        <li> Motion continues reading the rest of the motion.conf file. Any options from here will overrule the same
          option previously defines in a camera config file.</li>
        <li> Motion reads the command line option again overruling any previously defined options.</li>
      </ol>
      So always call the camera config files in the end of the motion.conf file. If you define options in motion.conf
      AFTER the camera file calls, the same options in the camera files will never be used. So always put the camera
      file call at the end of motion.conf.

      <p></p>
      Nearly all config options can be unique for a specific camera and placed in a camera config file.
      There are a few options that must be in motion.conf and cannot be in a camera config
      file: webcontrol_* , daemon, and camera.

      <p></p>
      If motion is built without specific features such as ffmpeg, mysql etc it will ignore the options that
      belong to those features.

      <p></p>
      <strong>Depreciated Parameters</strong>
      <p></p>
      Over the years, Motion has added many new configuration parameters and changed the name
      of a few of them so that there is some consistency to the parameter names.  Since version
      3.4.1, when a configuration parameter has a new name or additional functionality, Motion will
      try to interpret the value specified for the old parameter and translate it to the new parameter.
      These translations will be reported in the log as Motion is started.  To eliminate these warnings,
      ensure that a <a href="#webcontrol_port" >webcontrol_port</a> is specified and that the
      <a href="#webcontrol_interface" >webcontrol_interface</a> is specified as 0 (or not listed).  Then start
      motion, open a browser and navigate to the webcontrol port. When on that page, select
      <code>write configuration</code>.  This will re-write the configuration files with all the current
      parameters to Motion.  Note that depending upon where the configuration files are located, Motion
      may need to be started using <code>sudo</code>.

      <strong>Parameters in distributed configuration files</strong>
      <p></p>
      As of this writing, Motion includes over 150 parameters.  With this volume of parameters, navigating
      the configuration file with every possible has become onerous.  Starting with version 4.2, the distributed
      configuration files only include a limited subset of the configuration parameters.  Users can add to the
      files as needed the parameters that are applicable to their set up.  Users that wish to have every parameter
      listed and included in the configuration file can follow the process described immediately above in
      the <a href="#config_depreciated" >Remove Depreciated</a> section.
      i.e. Use the webcontrol interface to write out the configuration file.
      <p></p>
      Extended descriptions / documentation are not included in the configuration file.  This guide
      should be consulted for documentation of the configuration parameters.

        A signal can be sent from the command line by typing
        e.g. <code>kill -s SIGHUP pid</code>, where the last parameter is the process ID which
        you get by typing <code>ps -ef &brvbar; grep motion</code>. The PID is the first on the
        list which is the parent process for the threads.
        Motion responds to the following signals:

        <p></p>
        When this option is turned on, Motion starts in setup mode so that the
        parameters can be set more easily.  In setup mode two things happen:
        With 'motion -s' Motion runs in console mode instead of daemon. It outputs a lot of
        useful information for each frame from the camera. Each message is prefixed by [number]
        where number is the camera id number.
        When you look at the webcam stream you see a black image with numbers.
        What you see is the number of changed pixels, number of labeled areas and noise setting.
        When something moves you see the pixels detected as Motion in black and white. The largest
        labeled area (assuming despeckle is enabled and with the 'l' at the end) is blue. It is
        only the blue areas which is counted as Motion. If smartmask is enabled you see this as red areas.

        Here is a suggestion how to initially setup Motion.  (There are other ways to accomplish this.)
        <p></p>
        <ul>
          <li> Disable despeckle (comment it out in motion.conf).</li>
          <li> Disable smartmask</li>
          <li> Enable both the webcontrol and streams make sure to specify the webcontrol_parms. The below
            assumes that the webcontrol is specified as port 8080 and the stream as 8081
          </li>
          <li> Start Motion in setup mode</li>
          <li> Open a browser and connect to the webcontrol interface.
          <a href="http://localhost:8080/" rel="nofollow" target="_top">http://localhost:8080/</a> .
          You can now control and change almost anything while Motion is running. To disable a feature enter a space.</li>
          <li> Start by experimenting with noise level. Do this both during daylight and during darkness.
          You will be surprised to see how much noise a camera makes during night. Try using the automatic
          noise feature. It should work for most.</li>
          <li> Now try the despeckle feature. Enable it using the recommended default EedDl. If this is not enough experiment.
          Remember that the l must be the last letter.</li>
          <li> Set the threshold to what you want to trigger Motion.</li>
        </ul>
        In normal mode you can use the same setting with two browser tabs and experiment with
        settings of the camera if needed.
        From the web interface you can ask Motion to write all your changes back to the config files
        (motion.conf and camera config files).

        Use this option to specify the full path and filename to use
        for logging of the messages generated from Motion.  If this option
        is not defined, the stderr and syslog is used. Note that Motion
        can generate a LOT of messages and as a result, this option should
        be considered if the log_level is at any of the higher levels.

        <p></p>

        </ul>
        <p></p>
        This option specifies the level of verbosity of the messages sent from Motion.
        At a level of 8(DBG), there are a LOT of messages.  At a level of 1(EMR) virtually no
        messages will be output.
        <p></p>
        The various levels are [1..9] (EMR, ALR, CRT, ERR, WRN, NTC, INF, DBG, ALL).
        <p></p>
        When reporting any issues or errors associated with the Motion application,
        use the INF level.

        <p></p>
        The different components of Motion use different log types.  This option allows the
        user to only show the messages from particular components.  The choices for this option
        are: COR, STR, ENC, NET, DBL, EVT, TRK, VID, ALL

        </ul>
        <p></p>
        Enable native language for Motion webcontrol and log messages.
        <p></p>
        Motion will use the locale variable LANGUAGE for determining the webcontrol and log messages.  If
        messages or the webcontrol still display in English, then the messages / words have not yet been translated.
        <p></p>
        Please consider helping the developers by submitting pull requests to add new translations and correcting
        any inaccurate translations.
        <p></p>
        When this option is specified as 'off', the webcontrol and log messages will be provided in English.

        <p></p>
        This option specifies a camera name to be used in the format
        specifiers as well as on the web interface.

        <h3><a name="camera_id"></a> camera_id </h3>

          <li> Default: The sequence that the camera file is read</li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>
        This option is useful for situations where there are multiple cameras being
        used by Motion.  This option allows for the assignment of a numeric id number
        that can be used in database queries, format specifiers as well as for the web
        interface and streams.
        <p></p>
        If this option is not specified, the thread number as determined by Motion is used.  The
        number assigned to each camera must be unique.
        <p></p>
        When using multiple cameras, the default for the main thread is 0 (zero) but this can be
        overridden as needed by specifying a camera_id in the motion.conf file even though there
        are not any cameras running on this thread.
        <p></p>

        <h3><a name="camera"></a> camera </h3>

        </ul>
        <p></p>
        The full path and file name for the camera file.
        Motion allows for this line to be listed in the motion.conf file multiple
        times.  These specifications should be the LAST lines in the
        motion.conf file.
        See the <a href="#configfiles">Configuration Files</a> section within
        this guide for a complete discussion of what to put into the
        camera0.conf, camera1.conf, cameraX.conf files that would be specified
        in this option.
        <p></p>

        <h3><a name="camera_dir"></a> camera_dir </h3>
        <p></p>

        </ul>
        <p></p>
        This option specifies a directory to contain the individual camera configuration files.
        Any files ending in '.conf' in this directory will be read as a camera config file.
        <br />Users can disable a camera (config file) by renaming it so it does not end with '.conf'.

          <li> Default: Not defined = current directory</li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>
        The full path for the target directory for picture and movie files to be saved.
        The default is the current directory. This is the target directory for all snapshots,
        picture files and movie files.
        You will normally always want to specify this parameter as an absolute path.
        <p></p>
        Note that the file name options are all saved relative to this target_dir
        This means in principle that you can specify target_dir as '/' and be 100% flexible. But this is
        NOT recommended.  It is recommended that this directory be specified as deep as possible.

        </ul>
        <p></p>
        The video device to be used for capturing. Default is /dev/video0.
        See the <a href="#Basic_Setup">Basic Setup</a>
        section of this guide for an additional discussion of this option.
        <p></p>
        This option is the preferred way to specify the video4linux device name. If the camera does
        not work when specifying the device with this option, it is also possible to specify the device
        in the <a href="#netcam_url" >netcam_url</a>  with the v4l2 prefix option.  The
        <a href="#netcam_url" >netcam_url</a> option uses an alternative method to open and operate the
        device but has fewer options available. If the <a href="#netcam_url" >netcam_url</a> is used for
        either this alternative method or for a normal network camera, the videodevice option is ignored.
        <p></p>
        Since the exact device number is set by the kernel upon boot, when there is more than one video device
        it is possible that the particular cameras that were assigned to /dev/video0 and /dev/video1 may switch. In
        order to set up Motion so that a particular camera is always assigned the same way, users can set up
        a symbolic link using udev rules.  To do this a unique attribute must be identified for each camera. The
        camera attributes can be viewed by using the command
        <code>udevadm info -a -p $(udevadm info -q path -n /dev/video0) </code> while the camera is attached.  Usually
        a serial number can be used.  ("Usually" because some cameras have been observed to have the same serial
        number for different cameras)
        <p></p>
        Once a unique attribute has been identified for each camera, edit or create the file
        <code>/etc/udev/rules.d/99-local.rules</code>.
        <p></p>
        Assuming that the unique attribute for the camera was name and was
        <code>ATTR{name}=="Philips SPC 900NC webcam"</code> you would add the following line to the
        99-local.rules file:
        <code> KERNEL=="video[0-9]*", ATTR{name}=="Philips\ SPC\ 900NC*", SYMLINK+="video-webcam0"</code>
        <p></p>
        Once the change has been made and saved, reboot the computer and there should now be a "sticky" device called
        /dev/video-webcam0
        <p></p>


        <h3><a name="vid_control_params"></a>vid_control_params</h3>
        <p></p>
        <ul>
         <li> Type: String</li>
          <li> Range / Valid values: Max 4095 characters</li>
          <li> Default:  Not defined</li>
         </ul>
        <p></p>
        For v4l2 and bktr devices, most of the configuration options are automatic.  However most devices also allow
        the user to change certain settings to suit their needs.  The options which the camera manufacturer permits
        the user to change are called "controls".
        <p></p>
        The <a href="#vid_control_params" >vid_control_params</a> option allows users of Motion to change any of these
        controls.  The specific controls that can be changed is however entirely dependent upon the device.
        <p></p>
        This option replaces the previous configuration options for:
        <ul>
          <li> brightness</li>
          <li> contrast</li>
          <li> hue</li>
          <li> power_line_frequency</li>
          <li> saturation</li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>
        This option permits the V4l2 users of Motion to change the value of any control that is available
        to the device rather than being limited to only the 5 listed above.  For FreeBSD users with BKTR devices,
        the options are limited to brightness, contrast, hue and saturation due to the limitations of the driver.
        <p></p>
        While it always recommended that users remove older configuration options and only use the new options,
        if users have within the configuration file any of the depreciated options list above, Motion will
        continue to read those values and upgrade them into the new vid_control_params option.  The resulting
        pictures from the device may however may not be comparable due to different interpretations of the values.
        <p></p>
        It is therefore highly recommended that users remove the old configuration values and calibrate their devices
        only using this new configuration option.
        <p></p>
        To use this parameter, users will need to first identify the name or ID description of the particular control.
        Next, simply specify the control/id followed by an equal sign and then the desired value.  The specification
        of multiple controls can be specified by separating them with a comma.
        <p></p>
        Since the name of some controls can include a comma or spaces, names can also be specified by enclosing them
        in double quotes.
        <p></p>
        Finally, to help users know which controls are available for their device, the Motion log will report all the
        available controls, associated IDs and minimum/maximum values permitted at the
        <a href="#log_level" >log_level</a> of INF.
        <p></p>
        e.g.  Change the <a href="#log_level" >log_level</a>
        to INF, start up Motion with the device attached and specified, let it report items to the log and then
        shut Motion down.  Within the Motion log, it will list which controls the device has that can be adjusted.
        <p></p>
        The following is a sample output from the log and examples of how to specify the parameters

        <p></p>
        Example 1:  Set the gain to manual, then the gain to 50 and the brightness to 30
        <p></p>
        <code>vid_control_params "Gain, Automatic"=1,ID09963795=50, brightness=30</code>
        <p></p>
        a equally valid alternative method for specifying this example would be
        <p></p>
        <code>vid_control_params ID09963794=1,ID09963795=50, ID09963776=30</code>
        <p></p>
        or another way of specifying it could be
        <p></p>
        <code>vid_control_params ID09963794=1,"Gain"=50, "brightness"=30</code>
        <p></p>
        Example 2:  Set the saturation to 50 and the contrast to 100
        <p></p>
        <code>vid_control_params saturation=50,contrast=100</code>
        <p></p>
        As can be seen in these examples, the specification can use either the control ID or the name of the
        control.  If the control name has embedded blanks or commas, then it must be enclosed in quotes.  Special
        care should be taken when using the name.  As shown above, there is a comma that separates the name
        of the control versus the valid range of values.  That comma is NOT part of the control name and only
        delimits the end of the name for the Motion log.

        </ul>
        <p></p>
        The v4l2_palette allows the user to choose a palette to be use by Motion.  This
        is only the <u>preferred</u> option.  If the video device does not support this preferred format,
        Motion will loop through the available palettes to try to find one that is supported by both Motion
        and the device.
        Motion will report the supported palettes of the device when Motion starts when the log_level
        is specified as NTC or higher.
        <p></p>
        The default of 17 is highly preferred over <u>all</u> other formats since this the native
        format that Motion uses internally.
        <p></p>
        The following are each of the palette options.  For the Motion configuration,
        specify the numeric value as the Motion option.

        It is possible that after looping through all of the palette options for the camera, Motion will not
        find a palette that is acceptable for processing.  In this situation, it is possible to use the
        <a href="#netcam_url" >netcam_url</a> option with the v4l2 prefix.  When using the
        <a href="#netcam_url" >netcam_url</a> option, the v4l2_palette option can be used to specify the
        V4L2_PIX_FMT_MJPEG and V4L2_PIX_FMT_H264 options ONLY.  If any of the other palette options
        are specified when using the <a href="#netcam_url" >netcam_url</a> the v4l2_palette option
        is ignored and the camera default is used.

        <p></p>
        The V4L2_PIX_FMT_H264(21) option is valid ONLY when using the <a href="#netcam_url" >netcam_url</a> option.
        When V4L2_PIX_FMT_H264(21) is specified using the videodevice, Motion will change the v4l2_palette option to the
        default of V4L2_PIX_FMT_YUV420 (17)

        Input channel to use expressed as an integer number starting from 0.
        This option should normally be set to 1 for video/TV cards, and -1 for USB cameras.
        This parameter is used only with video capture cards that have more than one input.
        If you set the input number to values other than -1 USB cameras Motion will report
        an error message back. For video capture cards with tuners or multiple inputs such as
        S-VHS or Composite you may need to use this option to specify the correct input for
        the camera. Using a external application such as VLC which allows for easier specification
        of the input associated with the camera can assist  in determining the correct value for Motion.

        Let motion regulate the brightness of a video device. Only recommended for cameras without auto brightness
        Motion will try to adjust the brightness of the video device if the images captured are too dark or too light.
        This option will be most useful for video devices which sometimes don't have such an option in
        hardware.  The auto_brightness feature will adjust the brightness of the device up or down until the value
        is close to a target value.
        <p></p>
        By default, the target value is the midpoint between the minimum and maximum value permitted for the control
        being adjusted.  (See methods available below)
        <p></p>
        Users can specify a different target value by specifying a value for the control in
        the <a href="#vid_control_params">vid_control_params</a> option.
        <p></p>
        Motion allows for three possible methods for adjusting the brightness.
        <ul>
        <li> 1: Use the brightness control to regulate the brightness (equivalent to specifying on/yes)</li>
        <li> 2: Use the exposure control to regulate the brightness</li>

        Specifies the number of frames to capture before switching inputs, this way also slow switching (e.g. every second)
        is possible.  The Round Robin feature is automatically activated where multiple cameras are sharing the same video
        device. Each camera can then set different <a href="#input">input</a> or
        <a href="#frequency">frequency</a> options to change camera.
        If multiple cameras use the same video device, they each can capture roundrobin_frames number of frames before having
        to share the device with the other cameras.
        <p></p>
        Round Robin is not relevant for Network cameras or standard USB web cameras.  It is used with video capture
        cards which have multiple inputs per video chip.  This is not the ideal way to run multiple cameras.
        When the capture card changes input it takes some time before the decoder chip has synchronized to the new camera.
        You can improve this if you have expensive cameras with a synchronized input. Only one camera can be decoded
        at a time so if you have 4 cameras connected 3 of the cameras will need to wait for their
        turn. The fact that cameras have to take turns and the fact that you have to skip a few frames after
        each turn dramatically lowers the possible framerate. You can get a high framerate by viewing each
        camera for a long time. But then you may miss the action on one of the inactive cameras. If you can
        afford it avoid Round Robin and buy the more expensive type of capture cards that has one decoder chip
        per input. If you only need 2 or 3 cameras you can also simply put 2 or 3 cheap TV cards in the computer.
        Linux has no problem working with multiple TV cards. (or better yet, it multiple cheap network cameras)
        If multiple cameras use the same video device, they each can capture
        <a href="#roundrobin_frames">roundrobin_frames</a> number of frames
        before having to share the device with the other cameras.
        When another camera wants to watch another input or frequency or size the first
        <a href="#roundrobin_skip">roundrobin_skip</a> number of frames are skipped to allow the
        device to settle.  The last option
        <a href="#roundrobin_switchfilter">roundrobin_switchfilter</a> is supposed
        to prevent the change of camera from being detected
        as Motion. Its function is not perfect and sometimes prevents detection of real motion. You should start
        with having the option disabled and then try with the option enabled to see if you can skip less frames
        without loosing the detection of the type of motion you normally want to detect.

        Turns the switch filter on or off. The filter can distinguish between most switching noise and real motion. With this
        you can even set roundrobin_skip to 1 without generating much false detection.
        This is a round robin related feature used when you have a capture card with multiple inputs (controlled by the
        'input' option) on the same videodevice.

        The URL must return one single jpeg image, a mjpeg stream
        a RTSP stream, RTMP stream, file or ftp.  When getting a still image, make sure to validate that
        the camera is serving up a actual raw JPG file and not a HTML page with an embedded JPG which Motion

        Available prefixes to the URL:
        <p></p>
        <ul>
        <i>http://</i>
        <ul>
            This prefix uses the traditional http format and opens the netcam looking for a motion jpg image.
        </ul>
        <p></p>

        <i>ftp://</i>
        <ul>
            This prefix opens the ftp site and grabs a static image.  The camera will be expected to periodically
            replace that static image as it processes images.
        </ul>
        <p></p>

        <i>rtsp://</i>
        <ul>
            This prefix is the standard for all modern network cameras.  It is recommended that users search the
            web or the camera manual for the exact connection string to use for their camera.
            <p></p>
            Once a potential connection string is found, it should be validated as being functional using a
            external application such as ffplay or vlc.
            <p></p>
            The connection string that works for these applications is what needs to be specified for this option.
            <p></p>
            When using the rtsp format, Motion will ignore the netcam_keepalive and netcam_tolerant_check options.
        </ul>
        <p></p>

        <i>rtmp://</i>
        <ul>
            This prefix may be available on modern network cameras.  It is recommended that users search the
            web or the camera manual for the exact connection string to use for their camera.
            <p></p>
            Once a potential connection string is found, it should be validated as being functional using a
            external application such as ffplay or vlc.
            <p></p>
            The connection string that works for these applications is what needs to be specified for this option.
            <p></p>
            When using the rtmp format, Motion will ignore the netcam_keepalive and netcam_tolerant_check options.
        </ul>
        <p></p>

        <i>mjpeg://</i>
        <ul>
            This is an alternative prefix for http.  The mjpeg is replaced with http by Motion internally and forces the
            use of the ffmpeg libraries and the mjpeg format.
            <p></p>
            This option is equivalent to using <code>ffplay -f mjpeg http://{yourip}</code>.
            <p></p>
            In certain situations, this option may result in better results than using the http protocol.
            <p></p>
            Motion will ignore the netcam_keepalive and netcam_tolerant_check options when this format is specified.
        </ul>
        <p></p>

        <i>file://</i>
        <ul>
            This option allows for the processing of a existing movie file.  Motion will open the file and
            process the file at the framerate specified in the Motion configuration file.  Note that since the
            file may have been created using a different framerate than specified in the Motion config file,
            the file may be processed at either a faster or slower rate than real time.
            <p></p>
            A sample format for the netcam_url would be <code>netcam_url file:///home/user/cam1/cam1_20180817084027.mkv</code>
            <p></p>
            This option may be useful for "reprocessing" a movie created by Motion to fine tune the detection options.

        </ul>
        <p></p>

        <i>v4l2://</i>
        <ul>
            This option allows for an alternative method of using a v4l2 device that is not natively supported by Motion.
            <p></p>
            A sample format for the netcam_url would be <code>v4l2:///dev/video0</code>  Internally, this
            is equivalent to running the following from the command line <code>ffplay -f v4l2 /dev/video0</code>
            <p></p>
            Since this is not the preferred method of specifying a v4l2 device, many of the usual v4l2 controls such as
            <a href="#vid_control_params">vid_control_params</a> are ignored.
            The options <a href="#width">width</a>, <a href="#height">height</a> as well as two of
            the <a href="#v4l2_palette">v4l2_palette</a> can be used.  The two options
            for <a href="#v4l2_palette">v4l2_palette</a> which can be used are option 8 (V4L2_PIX_FMT_MJPEG) and
            option 21 (V4L2_PIX_FMT_H264).  If any other option is selected for the <a href="#v4l2_palette">v4l2_palette</a>
            Motion will revert to the camera default.
        </ul>
        <p></p>

        <i>mjpg://</i>
        <ul>
            This option processes very old netcams with non standard mjpeg formats.
        </ul>
        <p></p>

        <i>jpeg://</i>
        <ul>
            This option is for processing a static JPG file that is updated by processes external
            to Motion. It must be a local file and specified such as jpeg:///path/current.jpg

        The network camera high resolution URL.  This option can be used in conjunction with the netcam_url for
        rtsp/rtmp/mjpeg cameras. Users may specify the normal resolution url in the netcam_url which will be used for
        the motion detection and then specify the high resolution url for this parameter.  For mjpeg cameras,
        the url must use the <code>mjpeg</code> prefix and not <code>http</code>.
        <br>
        Motion detection on the normal resolution will trigger the saving of images from the high resolution stream.
        Note that the ONLY overlay that will be present on the resulting high resolution pictures and movies is the
        privacy mask.  The other overlays such as date/time, motion boxes, camera name, etc will not be
        included.  Users wishing to see those overlays on the resulting images and movies will need to specify the
        high resolution url as the netcam_url and not use this option.
        <p></p>
        If the netcam_url is not specified, this option is ignored.
        <p></p>
        When this option is used with the <a href="#movie_passthrough">movie_passthrough</a> even less processing occurs.

        The user requested decoder to use for rtsp/rtmp cameras.  Motion will try to open the camera using the decoder
        specified by this parameter. If it not successful, it will usually fall back to the default decoder.  This
        option may improve performance in certain situations for certain platforms and cameras.  Users can find the
        names of the decoders on their system by going to a command prompt and typing <code>ffmpeg -formats</code> and
        looking for the name of the decoder with a 'D' next to it and correlating this with the type of image
        provided from the camera.  Note that not all decoders will work with all cameras.  If the camera does not
        open using the requested decoder, specify a different decoder or leave this parameter empty to use the default.
        Additionally, ffmpeg will only list out the decoders that it was compiled to support.  Additional decoders
        may be available if ffmpeg is compiled from source.

        validate that the camera is functional with the raspistill/raspivid applications.
        <p></p>
        Please refer to the <a href="#Basic_Setup">Basic Setup</a> section

        This option allows the user to specify control parameters to the Pi camera.  The documentation of
        all of the options available to the Raspberry Camera module is beyond the scope of this guide.  In
        general, the command line options that are available via the raspistill / raspivid applications are
        the options that can be specified in this Motion configuration option.

        Some of the more frequently used options are:
        <ul>

        Motion does not scale v4l2 devices and http netcams so the value should be set to the actual
        size of the image provided by the device.
        In case of a rtsp/rtmp network camera, Motion will rescale the camera image to the
        requested dimensions.  This rescaling comes at a very high CPU cost so it
        is recommended that the network camera send the image in the same dimensions as included
        in the configuration file.
        <p></p>
        While Motion will not rescale the image provided, it will attempt to set the size of the image
        coming from the video4linux device to match the values provided for height/width.
        <p></p>
        It is important to realize that certain height/width combinations are only valid at
        certain frame rates.  The particular combinations which are valid are dependent upon
        the device.
        <p></p>
        For some device drivers like pwc (driver for Philips USB cameras) setting the
        size to a non-standard value makes the driver create an image of the nearest
        smaller size and create a gray band around the image to fit the size given by
        motion. Note that it is the driver and not motion that generates the gray band.
        Motion will try to detect motion in the entire image including the gray band.

        Maximum number of frames to be captured from the camera per second.
        The faster you fetch pictures from the camera the more CPU load you
        get and the more pictures get included when Motion is detected.
        Motion will stop storing pictures if the framerate is set to less than 2.
        Set this parameter to the maximum number of images per second that you want
        to store either as images or movies.
        To set intervals longer than one second use the 'minimum_frame_time' option instead.

        Minimum time in seconds between the capturing picture frames from the camera. Default: 0 = disabled - the capture
        rate is given by the camera framerate.
        This option is used when you want to capture images at a rate lower than 2 per second.

        Rotate image the given number of degrees. The rotation affects all saved images as well as movies.
        The rotation feature is used when the camera is hanging upside down (180 degrees) or if you choose a picture
        format in portrait instead of the normal landscape (90 or 270 degrees).
        Note that the CPU load increases when using this feature with a value other than 0. Also note that
        Motion automatically swaps width and height if you rotate 90 or 270 degrees, so you don't have to touch these options.

        You can use any conversion specifier in this option except %C. Date and time values are from the timestamp
        of the first image in the current event.  The idea is that %C can be used filenames and text_left/right for
        creating a unique identifier for each event.  Option text_event defines the value %C which then can be used in
        filenames and text_right/text_left. The text_event/%C uses the time stamp for the first image detected in a new
        event. %C is an empty string when no event is in progress (gap period expired). Pre_captured and
        minimum_motion_frames images are time stamped before the event happens so %C in text_left/right does not
        have any effect on those images.

        Threshold for declaring motion. The threshold is the number of changed
         pixels counted after noise filtering, masking, despeckle, and labelling.
         The 'threshold' option is the most important detection setting. When motion runs it compares
         the current image frame with the previous and counts the number of changed pixels after having
         processed the image with noise filtering, masking, despeckle and labeling. If more pixels than defined
         by 'threshold' have changed we assume that we have detected motion. Set the threshold as low as possible
         so that you get the motion you want detected but large enough so that you do not get detections from noise
         and plants moving. Note that the larger your frames are, the more pixels you have. So for large picture frame
         sizes you need a higher threshold.
         Use the -s (setup mode) command line option and/or the text_changes config file option to experiment to find
         the right threshold value. If you do not get small movements detected (see the mouse on the kitchen floor) lower
         the value. If motion detects too many birds or moving trees, increase the number. (Unless of course
         you are one of the many many users who use Motion to bird watch!)
         Practical values would be from a few hundred to thousands.

        This parameter specifies the maximum number of pixels that will trigger motion.  When the number of

        only trigger events when the number of pixels changes is above the threshold and less than
        the threshold_maximum.  A value of zero disables threshold_maximum.

        The noise level is used as a threshold for distinguishing between noise and motion.
        This is different from the threshold parameter. This is changes at pixel level. The purpose is to
        eliminate the changes generated by electric noise in the camera. Especially in complete darkness
        you can see the noise as small grey dots that come randomly in the picture. This noise can create
        false motion detection. What this parameter means is that the intensity of a pixel must change more
        than +/- the noise threshold parameter to be counted.

        Despeckle motion image using combinations of (E/e)rode or (D/d)ilate. And ending with optional (l)abeling.
        A way of tuning (by removing or enhancing) noise in the motion image. Options for the despeckle feature are
        any of 'e', 'E', 'd' or 'D'. This can be combined by a trailing 'l' (letter l) which enables the labeling
        feature.
        <p></p>
        Wind blowing grass and trees around or poor light conditions can cause a lot of dots (or noise) to appear in the
        motion image (See the section on Tuning Motion). This feature removes (or enhances!) this noise and so improves
        the reliability of motion.
        <p></p>
        The 'e' option removes diamonds, 'E' removes squares and alternating eE will remove circles. Each e/E you add will
        shrink the noise by a pixel all the way around. So 'despeckle Ee' will remove circles of radius 2. However, this
        will also shrink the detection by 2 and will affect the threshold. So to remove noise and then restore the detected
        motion to its original size try 'despeckle EedD'.
        After the despeckle feature is done you can let the labeling feature search for areas of connected pixels and "label"
        each area. The program will now trigger motion based on the number of changed pixels in the largest area. In other words,
        the largest labeled area has to be above the threshold to trigger a motion detected.
        The value EedDl is a good starting point. The possible combinations are endless and it requires many experiments to
        find the best combination. Just remember that the labeling feature only works as intended if it runs after the
        despeckle feature. Ie. the letter 'l' must be the last letter and only one 'l'.
        If you have very few problems with false detections leave this option either blank or at EedD which will remove
        most of the single pixel noise.

        The full path and filename for the masking pgm file.
        If needed, the mask will be resized to match the width and height of the frames being
        captured.
        If you have one or more areas of the camera image in which you do NOT want motion detected (e.g. a tree that
        moves in the wind or a corner of the picture where you can see cars/pedestrians passing by) you need a mask file.
        This file is a picture that you create in your favorite photo editing program. The areas that you want detected must
        be white. The area that you want ignored must be black. The pgm image should be the same size (number of pixels high
        and wide) as the pictures that are taken by the camera so you can define the correct area to mask.
        You can adjust sensitivity by using gray tones.
        If you do not have a mask file disable this option by not having it in the config file or comment
        it out.
        If you are using the <a href="#rotate">rotate</a>
        or <a href="#flip_axis">flip_axis</a> options, note that the mask is
        applied <em>after</em> the rotation.
        <p></p>
        <strong>Detailed Description</strong>
        <p></p>
        The mask file must be a pgm format image file (portable gray map). Note that you must choose the BINARY format.
        <p></p>
        To use this feature create an image of exact the same size as the ones you get from your camera.
        Then make it purely white for the areas you want detected and
        black for the areas you want ignored.  You can also make gray areas where
        you want to lower the sensitivity to motion. Normally you will stick to pure black and white.
        <p></p>
        One method for generating the mask file is as follows.
        <p></p>
        Take a motion captured picture, edit it with black and white for the mask and export it as a pgm file.
        with a program such as gimp.

        If you cannot save in this format save as a grayscale jpg and then you can convert it to pgm format with
        <p></p>
        <code>djpeg -grayscale -pnm [inputfile] &gt; mask.pgm</code>

        <p></p>
        (assuming you have djpeg installed - part of the jpeg lib package).
        <p></p>
        Note that the mask file option masks off the detection of motion. The entire picture is still shown on the picture.
        This means that you cannot use the feature to mask off an area that you do not want people to see.  Instead
        use the mask_privacy option.

        Below are an example of a webcam picture and a mask file to prevent the detection cars in the street.

        described above.  The difference with this parameter is that while the mask_file excludes the section from
        detecting motion, this file excludes the section of the image completely.
        <p></p>
        mask_privacy is applied before detection so no motion will ever be detected in the excluded area.
        This parameter could however still be used with the mask_file.  e.g.  This file could exclude the
        neighbors yard and the <a href="#mask_file">mask_file</a> would exclude the blowing tree from motion
        detection.  The resulting
        pictures/movies would show solid black in place of the neighbors yard but the tree would still be in
        the pictures/movies.

        Speed for the smart mask. Default is 0 = DISABLED. 1 is slow, 10 is fast.
        Smartmask is a dynamic, self-learning mask. Smartmask will disable sensitivity
        in areas with frequent motion (like trees in the wind). Sensitivity is turned
        on again after some time of no more motion in this area. The built mask is a bit
        larger at the borders than the actual motion was. This way smartmask works more
        reliable when sudden moves occur under windy conditions.
        <p></p>
        Fast means here that the mask is built quick, but it is also not staying very long with no more motion.
        Slow means that it takes a while until the mask is built but it also stays longer. A good start value
        for smart_mask_speed is 5. This setting is independent from the <a href="#framerate">framerate</a>. The
        attack and decay time
        is constant over all available framerates.
        When smartmask is enabled and motion is also configured to either write motion-images or motion-mpegs,
        the current smartmask is copied as an overlay into the black/white motion-pictures/mpegs in red colour.
        Same thing happens to the webcam stream when Motion runs in <a href="#setup_mode">setup_mode</a>.
        That way you can
        easily adjust smart_mask_speed.
        <p></p>
        The <a href="#mask_file">mask_file</a> option provides a static mask to turn off sensitivity in certain areas.
        This is very useful to mask a street with cars passing by all day long etc...
        <p></p>
        But imagine a scenario with large bushes and big trees where all the leaves are moving
        in the wind also triggering motion from time to time even with <a href="#despeckle">despeckle</a> turned on. Of
        course you can also define a static mask here, but what if the bushes are growing during
        spring and summer? Well, you have to adapt the mask from time to time. What if the camera
        position moves slightly? What if someone grows new plants in your garden? You always have to setup a new static mask.
        <p></p>
        The answer to this problem is the smart mask feature A dynamic, self-learing mask.
        <p></p>
        Smart mask will disable sensitivity in areas with frequent motion (like trees in the wind).
        Sensitivity is turned on again after some time of no more motion in this area. The built mask
        is a bit larger at the borders than the actual motion. This way smartmask works more reliably
        when sudden moves occur under windy conditions.

        Picture frames must contain motion at least the specified number of frames in a row before they are
        detected as true motion. At the default of 1, all motion is detected. Valid range is 1 to thousands,
        but it is recommended to keep it within 1-5.
        Note that the picture frames are buffered by Motion and once motion is detected also the first frames
        containing motion are saved so you will not miss anything.
        The feature is used when you get many false detections when the camera changes light sensitivity or light changes.
        Even though Motion accepts large values you should set this to a relatively low number
        (below 10). For each step larger than 1 Motion reserves space in RAM for the picture frame buffer. If you have a
        large value Motion will miss many frames from the camera while it is processing the all the pictures in the buffer.

        The seconds of no motion detection that triggers the end of an event.
        An event is defined as a series of motion images taken within a short timeframe.
        The value -1 is allowed and disables
         events causing all Motion to be written to one single movie file and no pre_capture.
         If set to 0, motion is running in gapless mode. An
         event ends right after no more motion is detected and post_capture is over.

        Disabling events has bad side effects on
        noise_tune and smartmask. Both features can only work properly outside an event.
        When event_gap is set to -1, both features don't work properly anymore.

        that is needed to be defined as a new event.
        The timer starts after the last motion is detected and <a href="#post_capture">post_capture</a> images
        have been saved and appended to open movie files.
        Any motion detected before the gap timer times out resets the gap timer so it starts counting over again.
        The option 'event_gap' is important. It defines how long a period of no motion detected it takes before we say an event is over. An event is defined as a series of motion images taken within a short timeframe. E.g. a person walking through the room is an event that may have caused 10 single jpg images to be stored. Motion detected includes post_captured frames set by the 'post_capture' option. The 'gap' option defines how long a pause between detected motions that is needed to be defined as a new event. A good starting value is 60 seconds.
        The way 'gap' works in more technical terms is:
        <ul>
          <li> A timer that timeouts 'event_gap' seconds after the last video frame with motion is detected.</li>
          <li> If <a href="#post_capture">post_capture</a> is activated then the gap timer starts counting after the last image of the <a href="#post_capture">post_capture</a> buffer has been saved.</li>
          <li> The event_gap timer is reset and starts all over each time new motion is detected, so you will not miss any action by having a short 'gap' value. It will just create more events (e.g. more mpegs files)</li>
        </ul>
        The event_gap value impacts many functions in Motion.
        <ul>
          <li> When the timer runs out the event number is increased by one next time motion is detected.
               When you use the %v conversion specifier in filenames or text features this means that the
               number in filename or text increased by one.</li>
          <li> The <a href="#pre_capture">pre_capture</a> feature only works at the beginning of an event. So if you have a very large 'event_gap'
               value <a href="#pre_capture">pre_capture</a> is not working very often.</li>
          <li> When you make movies using the ffmpeg features a new movie file is started at the beginning of an event
               when the first motion is detected. When 'event_gap' seconds has passed without motion (and post_captured frames
               saved) the movie files are completed and closed.</li>
          <li> Do not use large event_gap values to generate one large movie file.
               If Motion stops working this movie file never gets properly completed and closed
               you will not be able to view it.</li>
          <li> Some of the tracking features sets the camera back to the center position when an event is over.</li>
        </ul>

          <li> Type: Integer</li>
          <li> Range / Valid values: 0 - 100s</li>
          <li> Default: 0 (disabled)</li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>
        Specifies the number of pre-captured (buffered) pictures from before motion
        was detected that will be output at motion detection.
        The recommended range is 0 to 5.  It is not recommended to use large values.
        Large values will cause Motion to skip video frames and cause unsmooth movies.
        <p></p>
        This is because Motion is processing all the buffered images including saving jpegs,
        encoding the movie, writing to databases and executing external programs immediately
        after the first image is detected as Motion.
        <p></p>
        Motion will not grab another image until this is done. This means that even moderate values for pre_capture combined
        with high framerates will mean that you will probably miss many frames of Motion.
        <p></p>
        To create smooth movies use larger values of <a href="#post_capture">post_capture</a> instead.
        <p></p>
        Motion buffers the number of picture frames defined by 'pre_capture'. When motion is detected the pictures in the
        buffer are included in the movie.  The effect is that it seems the program knew in advance
        that the event was going to take place and started the recording before it actually happened.
        This is a nice feature that give more complete video clips of an event.
        <p></p>
        If pre_capture is set to 0 the feature is disabled. The recommended value would be approx 0.5 second of
        video so the value should be defined so it fits the framerate and the desired pre-capture time.
        You can in theory have up to 100s of pre-captured frames but naturally this makes motion leave a larger footprint in
        the memory of the computer.
        <p></p>
        It is therefore recommended to use relatively small values for pre_capture.
        Depending on your chosen framerate and depending on the features enabled values from 1-5 are sensible.
        <p></p>
        To get a smooth movie use a large value for <a href="#post_capture">post_capture</a> which does not cost any performance hit or RAM
        space.

        Specifies the number of frames to be captured after motion has been detected.
        The purpose of this is mainly to create smooth video clips each time motion is detected. Use it to you personal
        taste (and disk space)..
        This option is the preferred way to create continuous movies. Post_capture does not consume extra RAM and it
        does not create pauses in the movie even with large values.
        If you only store movies and do not have output_normal on, then the recommended post_capture value is what is
        equivalent to 1-5 seconds (Don't forget to multiply the seconds desired by the framerate for this parameter)

        <p></p>
        <strong>Security Warning!</strong>
        <p></p>
        These features mean you have to pay attention to the following.
        <ul>
        <li> Anyone with access to the remote control port (http) can execute any command on your computer with
        the same privileges as the user running Motion.
        Anyone can access your control port if you have not either limited access to localhost or
        limited access using firewalls in the server.
        You should always have a router between a machine running Motion with remote control
        enabled and the Internet and make sure the Motion control port is not accessible from the outside.
        </li>
        <li> If you limit control port to localhost you still need to take care of any user logging into the server
        with any kind of GUI or terminal session. All it takes is a browser or single command line execution to
        change settings in Motion.
        </li>
        <li> It is a good idea to run Motion as a harmless user. Not as root!!</li>

        "best" requires a little more CPU power and resources compared to "first".
        If you set it to "best" Motion saves the picture with most changed pixels during the event.

        parameter.  By specifying the container (mkv) and then appending a colon and the ffmpeg codec name Motion
        will attempt to use the specified codec for the container.  This permits options such as encoding the h265 codec
        into a mkv container instead of mp4 by specifying the option as <code>mkv:libx265</code>

        When using a RTSP, RTMP, mjpeg and some V4l2 cameras, create movie files of the motion with the packets
        obtained directly from the camera.
        <p></p>
        For mjpeg cameras, the url must be specified using the <code>mjpeg</code> prefix rather than
        as <code>http</code>
        <p></p>
        For v4l2 cameras to use the movie_passthrough, they must be specified using the
        <a href="#netcam_url">netcam_url</a> parameter and the <code>v4l2</code> prefix.
        <u>Only</u> webcams that provide mjpeg (<a href="#v4l2_palette">v4l2_palette</a> option 8)
        or H264 (<a href="#v4l2_palette">v4l2_palette</a> option 21) will work with the
        <a href="#movie_passthrough">movie_passthrough</a>.
        <p></p>

        <p></p>
        When using only the single <a href="#netcam_url">netcam_url</a> this option will reduce the processing
        required when encoding the images to the resulting movie file.  Decoding of the image will still occur on the
        image in order to process the motion detection.
        <p></p>
        When using both the <a href="#netcam_url">netcam_url</a> and the <a href="#netcam_highres">netcam_highres</a>
        what will occur is that normal resolution stream will be captured and decoded, when motion is detected, the
        high resolution images will be captured and processed into the movie file without going through the decode/encode
        processing.
        <p></p>
        This option should reduce CPU usage but does increase memory requirements.
        <p></p>
        No image processing is performed so text overlays, privacy masks etc will not be on the resulting video.  The
        resulting movie may also include a few extra frames at the start that would not exist if the movie was created
        without the passthrough option.
        <p></p>
        Since this option bypasses the decoding of the high resolution images to reduce CPU, when images are saved via
        the <a href="#picture_output">picture_output</a> option, the pictures provided will be from the normal resolution stream.

        This option specifies whether to send the output to a
        pipe for external encoding into a movie.
        <p></p>
        Piping raw video to stdout has some advantages comparing to using built-in ffmpeg encoder.
        <br />First, you can use any encoder that supports RAW frames from stdin so you are not limited to the formats
        that are currently implemented in motion. See examples in <a href="#movie_extpipe">movie_extpipe</a>
        <br />Second, external encoders utilize separate cpu core(s) on multi-core systems so movie encoding
        is offloaded from main motion thread to separate core(s) giving noticeable performance boost
        <p></p>

      <h3><a name="OptDetail_Pipe"></a>Output - Pipe Options</h3>
      <ul>
        <p></p>
        Motion provides two pipe variations.  The first option is a v4l2loopback device with normal images.
        Using this pipe option, the video that is captured from the v4l2 device is piped into a new
        v4l2 device using the v4l2loopback software.  This piping is desired when the user wishes to
        use the video device at the same time as Motion is using the same device.  By default, only
        one application can have a device open at one time.  Unlike a physical device, the videoloopback
        devices take both input and output.  The module simply takes anything that comes on its input
        and send it out at the output.
        <p></p>
        When you install the video loopback device it will create a new device for example /dev/video1 while
        the actual webcam device would be /dev/video0.  You can then tell motion to open the physical
        device (/dev/video0) and "pipe" the video signal to the /dev/video1.  You will then be able to open
        the /dev/video1 device with external videoplayers such as VLC and and look at the pictures live.
        VLC is "fooled" to think it is looking at a real camera.
        <p></p>
        <strong>Installing</strong>
        <p></p>
        The video loopback device can be added installed via apt in many distributions.  The package tested
        with Motion is v4l2loopback-dkms.  Once the package is installed, you just need to run
        <code>sudo modprobe v4l2loopback</code>.  This will add a new video device that you
        can use for the loopback.  It is believed that there are additional options associated with the
        v4l2loopback that allows for adding more than one device.  See the documentation of the v4l2loopback
        project for additional details.
        <p></p>
        To activate the vloopback device in Motion set the 'video_pipe' option in the motion.conf file to the
        device name associated with the one created by v4l2loopback.
        <br />You can also view the special motion pictures where you see the changed pixels by setting the option
        'video_pipe_motion' in motion.conf. When setting the video_pipe and/or video_pipe_motion options
        specify the input device as e.g. /dev/video1.

        De-activating should be done with this command
        <p></p>
        <code>sudo modprobe -r v4l2loopback</code>

      <h3><a name="OptDetail_Webcontrol"></a>Web Control</a> </h3>
      <ul>
        <p></p>
        Motion has a limited web interface to control some parameters while running.  By default, the
        changing of any parameters via the web interface is disabled
        via the <a href="#webcontrol_parms">webcontrol_parms</a> configuration option.  This is for
        security purposes.  If the <a href="#webcontrol_parms">webcontrol_parms</a> is enabled, some Motion
        configuration options can be changed while Motion is running.  Other configuration options must be
        saved and Motion restarted to become effective.
        <p></p>
        If your <a href="#webcontrol_port">webcontrol_port</a> is 8080, then open the following from the same
        machine on which Motion is running
        <a href="http://localhost:8080/" rel="nofollow" target="_top">http://localhost:8080/</a>
        <p></p>
        To access the web control from remote machine, first set the
        <a href="#webcontrol_localhost">webcontrol_localhost</a> to <code>off</code> then
        connect using the IP of the remote machine instead of <code>localhost</code> (example
         <a href="http://192.168.1.4:8080/" rel="nofollow" target="_top">http://192.168.1.4:8080/</a>).
        <p></p>
        If you want to use a script or cron to automatically change Motion settings while Motion runs, use a
        program that can fetch or send a webpage. Common programs are <code> wget </code>, <code>lwp-request</code>
        and <code>curl</code>.
        <p></p>
        Example to pause motion detection
        <p></p>
        <code>
        lwp-request http://localhost:8080/0/detection/pause
        </code>
        <p></p>
        Example to start motion detection
        <p></p>
        <code>
        lwp-request http://localhost:8080/0/detection/start
        </code>
        <p></p>
        Example script to update the text_left with cpu load (verbose for clarity)

        <p></p>
        To control from your own software (for example your own PHP front end) the motion.conf
        option <a href="#webcontrol_interface">webcontrol_interface</a> can be set to <code>1</code>(text) which
        will cause Motion to remove the html tags in the responses and there is no navigation of any pages via
        a web browser.
        <p></p>
        The following definitions will be used when summarizing the commands that are available for control
        of Motion.
        <ul>
          <li><code>{IP}</code> The IP address of the computer running Motion</li>
          <li><code>{port}</code> The port specified for the webcontrol</li>
          <li><code>{camid}</code> The <a href="#camera_id">camera_id</a> of the camera.</li>
          <li><code>{parm}</code> The Motion configuration parameter requested.</li>
          <li><code>{value1}</code> The first value of the Motion configuration parameter requested.</li>
          <li><code>{value2}</code> The second value of the Motion configuration parameter requested.</li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>
        The following are the commands available.
        <p></p>
	      <ul>
          <li><code>{IP}:{port}/{camid}/config/list</code> Lists all the configuration values for the camera.  </li>
          <li><code>{IP}:{port}/{camid}/config/set?{parm}={value1}</code>Set the value for the requested parameter </li>
          <li><code>{IP}:{port}/{camid}/config/get?query={parm}</code> Return the value currently set for the parameter.</li>
          <li><code>{IP}:{port}/{camid}/config/write</code> Write the current parameters to the file.</li>
          <li><code>{IP}:{port}/{camid}/detection/status</code> Return the current status of the camera.</li>
          <li><code>{IP}:{port}/{camid}/detection/connection</code> Return the connection status of the camera.</li>
          <li><code>{IP}:{port}/{camid}/detection/start</code> Start or resume motion detection. </li>
          <li><code>{IP}:{port}/{camid}/detection/pause</code> Pause the motion detection.</li>
          <li><code>{IP}:{port}/{camid}/action/eventstart</code> Trigger a new event.</li>
          <li><code>{IP}:{port}/{camid}/action/eventend</code> Trigger the end of a event.</li>
          <li><code>{IP}:{port}/{camid}/action/snapshot</code> Create a snapshot</li>
          <li><code>{IP}:{port}/{camid}/action/restart</code> Shutdown and restart Motion</li>
          <li><code>{IP}:{port}/{camid}/action/quit</code> Close all connections to the camera</li>
          <li><code>{IP}:{port}/{camid}/action/end</code> Entirely shutdown the Motion application</li>
          <li><code>{IP}:{port}/{camid}/track/center</code> Send command to center PTZ camera</li>
          <li><code>{IP}:{port}/{camid}/track/set?x={value1}&y={value2}</code> Send command to PTZ camera to move
            to location specified by x and y</li>
          <li><code>{IP}:{port}/{camid}/track/set?pan={value1}&tilt={value2}</code> Send command to PTZ camera to
            pan to value1 and tilt to value2</li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>
        As a general rule, when the {camid} references the camera_id in the main motion.conf file, the webcontrol
        actions referenced above are going to be applied to every camera that is connected to Motion.  This camera_id
        is usually specified as 0 (zero).  So issuing a command of <code>{IP}:{port}/0/detection/pause</code> is
        going to pause all the cameras.
        <p></p>
        A point of clarification with respect to the differences between <code>pause</code>, <code>quit</code>,
        and <code>end</code>.  When the action of <code>pause</code> is executed, Motion will stop the motion detection
        processing and of course all events but will continue to process and decode images from the camera.  This allows
        for a faster transition when the user executes a <code>start</code>  The <code>quit</code> action conversely not
        only stops the motion detection but also disconnects from the camera and decoding of images.  To start motion
        detection after a <code>quit</code>, the user must execute a <code>restart</code> which will reinitialize the
        connection to the camera.  And since the camera was completely disconnect, it can take more than a few seconds
        for Motion to fully start and have the camera available for processing or viewing.  Finally, there is an
        option for <code>end</code>.  This option completely terminates the Motion application.  It closes all connections
        to all the cameras and terminates the application.  This may be required when running Motion in daemon mode.
        Note that there is no way to restart the Motion application from the webcontrol interface after processing
        a <code>end</code> request.

        <p></p>
        If the item above is available via the HTML/CSS interface, it is also possible to see the exact URL sent
        to Motion in the log.  Change the log level to 8 (debug), then open up the Motion webcontrol interface and
        perform the action in question.  In the log Motion will report the exact URL sent to Motion that performed
        the action.

        <strong>ALERT!</strong> Security Warning! This feature also means you have to pay attention
        to the following.
        <ul>
          <li> Anyone with access to the remote control port (http) can alter the values of options
          and save files anywhere on your server with the same privileges as the user running Motion.
          They can execute any command on your computer with the same privileges as the user running Motion.
          Anyone can access your control port if you have not either limited access to localhost or limited
          access using firewalls in the server. You should always have a router between a machine running
          Motion with remote control enabled and the Internet and make sure the Motion control port is not
          accessible from the outside.  Also make sure to adjust the
          <a href="#webcontrol_parms">webcontrol_parms</a> to the lowest level possible.</li>
          <li> If you limit control port to localhost you still need to take care of any user logging
            into the server with any kind of terminal session.</li>
          <li> Run Motion as a harmless user. DO NOT RUN AS ROOT!!</li>
        </ul>

      <h3><a name="OptDetail_Stream"></a> Live Stream</a> </h3>
      <ul>
        Motion has simple webcam server built in which allows for streaming the images from the
        camera(s).
        <p></p>
        The streams are generated in "multipart jpeg" format (mjpeg) which most browsers can display.  If
        the browser does not directly open the stream, it may be possible to manually create a simple HTML
        page that references the stream.
        <p></p>
        Some regular stream players such as mplayer, ffplay and avplay may open the streams as well by specifying
        the network stream as
        <code>
        http://localhost:mystreamportnumber/
        </code>
        <p></p>
        While normally the stream players will open after a bit, it may be useful to also provide the format such as
        <code>
        ffplay -f mjpeg http://localhost:mystreamportnumber/
        </code>
        <p></p>
        It has been observed by the author that VLC will not open the stream.  This is not a Motion limitation but
        instead is related to the general VLC support for MJPG http streams.
        <p></p>
        While the above examples indicate the Motion streams can be accessed as
        <code>
        http://localhost:mystreamportnumber/
        </code>
        Motion does provide other options for accessing the streams and images.  In addition to sub-streams,
        motion image streams and static images, Motion can also be configured to use just a single port for
        accessing streams to all cameras.  This is accomplished by specifying a stream port within the
        motion.conf file and also using separate camera files.  The following examples should clarify the
        methods by which streams can be accessed:
        <ul>
          <li><code>{IP}</code> The IP address of the computer running Motion</li>

        The TCP port that Motion will send the main stream.
        The stream port must be different than the
        <a href="#webcontrol_port">webcontrol_port</a>.  If the port is specified
        within the motion.conf file (as opposed to being specified in the camerax.conf files), then
        Motion will provide all streams on that single port by specifying a different url.  See the
        <a href="#OptDetail_Stream">stream</a> section above for further details and
        examples of how ports can be specified.  If setting a unique port for each camera
        good value may be to select is 8081 for camera 1, 8082 for camera 2, 8083 for camera 3 etc.

        format so that all the images can be viewed by standard browsers.
        <p></p>
        This parameter indicates the percentage to scale the stream image when it is placed on the page.
        Note that this is scaled on the browser side, Motion will keep sending full frame.

        If the webcontrol page has HTML enabled, Motion displays all images of the streams on the home webcontrol page
        in HTML format so that all the images can be viewed by standard browsers.
        <p></p>
        This parameter determines whether the image is placed on a new line in the webcontrol web page.
        <p></p>
        Preview images are placed on to the webcontrol home page in camera id number order.
        This parameter allows the user some flexibility in organizing the images on the page.
        <p></p>
        Setting this parameter to off will set the image to the right of any image from a lower numbered thread number.
        Setting it to 'on' will place the image on the start of the next line(below).
        <p></p>
        Users that require a more polished and customized preview page are encouraged to create their own
        local HTML page that reference the URL streams.

      <h3><a name="OptDetail_Database"></a>Database</h3>
      <ul>
        Motion can be compiled with MySQL, PostgreSQL or SQLite3 database support.
        When enabled Motion can be configured to add a record to a table in the database
        as specified by the sql_query. The query can contain the fields that are used and the
        values are given by using <a href="#conversion_specifiers">Conversion Specifiers</a> for dynamic data like
        the filename, time, number of detected pixels etc.
        Motion does not place any binary images in the database and it cannot remove old records.
        <p></p>
        Motion only adds records to the database when files are created.
        The database contains records of saved files which means to get a
        record in the database the feature that enables for example motion
        detection, timelapse, snapshots etc must be enabled.
        The sql_log options define which types of files are logged in the database.
        <p></p>
        The following are sample create table queries for different databases.
        <p></p>

        SQL query that executes against the event table which tracks the unique events of motion.
        <p></p>
        Once the new record is added to this table, the mysql function <code><b>mysql_insert_id</b></code> is then
        executed to provide the key back into the <code>dbeventid</code> specifier.
        <p></p>
        The <code>dbeventid</code> specifier can then be used in the <code>sql_query</code> as a parameter
        to that query for inserting into the table.
        <p></p>
        Although this query is run for all the different database options, the <code>dbeventid</code> is
        only set for mysql databases.  For the other databases, the <code>dbeventid</code> is always set
        to zero.
        <p></p>
        <p></p>
        You can use <a href="#conversion_specifiers">Conversion Specifiers</a> within the query.

        Motion can move the camera to a fixed position given in degrees pan (left-right) and tilt (down-up).
        Movement can be set with absolute coordinates or relative to current position. There is also an auto tracking
        feature for the Logitech Quickcam Sphere/Orbit but it is not very mature. Review and revise the Motion code
        regarding tracking if these features are required.  The Motion developers do not have any tracking cameras
        so it is unlikely that tracking features will be developed in any way.  (We have no way to test anything!)

        Motion has special tracking options which use either a serial stepper motor controller,
        an iomojo smile cam or a Philips WebCam driver compatible pan/tilt camera such as
        the Logitech Quickcam Sphere or Orbit.
        <p></p>
        To disable tracking, set this to 0 and the other track options are ignored.
        <p></p>
        Value 1 is for the special Motion Tracking project using a stepper motor and a home made controller.
        <p></p>
        Value 2 is for the iomojo smilecam
        <p></p>
        Value 3 is for pwc type USB tracking cameras such as the Logitech Quickcam Sphere/Orbit which is driven
        by the pwc (Philips WebCam) driver. To use this camera your version of pwc must be at least 8.12.
        <p></p>
        Value 4 is the generic track type. This option executes the
        <a href="#track_generic_move">track_generic_move</a> script.  Users can write their own script
        to move the camera based upon the <a href="#conversion_specifiers">Conversion Specifiers</a> passed to the
        script and/or based upon the environment variables set by Motion.
        <p></p>
        Value 5 is for uvcvideo type USB tracking cameras such as the Logitech Quickcam Sphere/Orbit MP which is driven
        by the uvcvideo driver.
