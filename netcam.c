/*
 *      netcam.c
 *
 *      Module for handling network cameras.
 *
 *      This code was inspired by the original netcam.c module
 *      written by Jeroen Vreeken and enhanced by several Motion
 *      project contributors, particularly Angel Carpintero and
 *      Christopher Price.
 *
 *      Copyright 2005, William M. Brack
 *      This software is distributed under the GNU Public license
 *      Version 2.  See also the file 'COPYING'.
 *
 *
 *      When a netcam has been configured, instead of using the routines
 *      within video.c (which handle a CCTV-type camera) the routines
 *      within this module are used.  There are only four entry points -
 *      one for "starting up" the camera (netcam_start), for "fetching a
 *      picture" from it (netcam_next), one for cleanup at the end of a
 *      run (netcam_cleanup), and a utility routine for receiving data
 *      from the camera (netcam_recv).
 *
 *      Two quite different types of netcams are handled.  The simplest
 *      one is the type which supplies a single JPEG frame each time it
 *      is accessed.  The other type is one which supplies an mjpeg
 *      stream of data.
 *
 *      For each of these cameras, the routine taking care of the netcam
 *      will start up a completely separate thread (which I call the "camera
 *      handler thread" within subsequent comments).  For a streaming camera,
 *      this handler will receive the mjpeg stream of data from the camera,
 *      and save the latest complete image when it begins to work on the next
 *      one.  For the non-streaming version, this handler will be "triggered"
 *      (signalled) whenever the main motion-loop asks for a new image, and
 *      will start to fetch the next image at that time.  For either type,
 *      the most recent image received from the camera will be returned to
 *      motion.

 * The following three routines (netcam_url_match, netcam_url_parse and
 * netcam_url_free are for 'parsing' (i.e. separating into the relevant
 * components) the URL provided by the user.  They make use of regular
 * expressions (which is outside the scope of this module, so detailed
 * comments are not provided).  netcam_url_parse is called from netcam_start,
 * and puts the "broken-up" components of the URL into the "url" element of
 * the netcam_context structure.
 *
 * Note that the routines are not "very clever", but they work sufficiently
 * well for the limited requirements of this module.  The expression:
 *   (http)://(((.*):(.*))@)?([^/:]|[-.a-z0-9]+)(:([0-9]+))?($|(/[^:]*))
 * requires
 *   1) a string which begins with 'http', followed by '://'
 *   2) optionally a '@' which is preceded by two strings
 *      (with 0 or more characters each) separated by a ':'
 *      [this is for an optional username:password]
 *   3) a string comprising alpha-numerics, '-' and '.' characters
 *      [this is for the hostname]
 *   4) optionally a ':' followed by one or more numeric characters
 *      [this is for an optional port number]
 *   5) finally, either an end of line or a series of segments,
 *      each of which begins with a '/', and contains anything
 *      except a ':'

/**
 * netcam_read_html_jpeg
 *
 * This routine reads a jpeg image from the netcam.  When it is called,
 * the stream is already positioned just after the image header.
 *
 * This routine is called under the four variations of two different
 * conditions:
 *     1) Streaming or non-streaming camera
 *           Note: Keep-Alive is supported for non-streaming cameras,
 *           if enabled in the netcam's config structure.
 *     2) Header does or does not include Content-Length
 * Additionally, if it is a streaming camera, there must always be a
 * boundary-string.
 *
 * The routine will (attempt to) read the JPEG image.  If a Content-Length
 * is present, it will be used (this will result in more efficient code, and
 * also code which should be better at detecting and recovering from possible
 * error conditions).
 *
 * If a boundary-string is present (and, if the camera is streaming, this
 * *must* be the case), the routine will assure that it is recognized and
 * acted upon.
 *
 * Our algorithm for this will be as follows:
 *     1) If a Content-Length is present, set the variable "remaining"
 *        to be equal to that value, else set it to a "very large"
 *        number.
 *        WARNING !!! Content-Length *must* to be greater than 0, even more
 *        a jpeg image cannot be less than 300 bytes or so.
 *     2) While there is more data available from the camera:
 *        a) If there is a "boundary string" specified (from the initial
 *           header):
 *           i)   If the amount of data in the input buffer is less than
 *                the length of the boundary string, get more data into
 *                the input buffer (error if failure).
 *           ii)  If the boundary string is found, check how many
 *                characters remain in the input buffer before the start
 *                of the boundary string.  If that is less than the
 *                variable "remaining", reset "remaining" to be equal
 *                to that number.
 *        b) Try to copy up to "remaining" characters from the input
 *           buffer into our destination buffer.
 *        c) If there are no more characters available from the camera,
 *           exit this loop, else subtract the number of characters
 *           actually copied from the variable "remaining".
 *     3) If Content-Length was present, and "remaining" is not equal
 *        to zero, generate a warning message for logging.
 *
 *
 * Parameters:
 *      netcam          Pointer to netcam context
 *
 *
 * Returns:             0 for success, -1 for error

/**
 * netcam_read_mjpg_jpeg
 *
 *     This routine reads from a netcam using a MJPG-chunk based
 *     protocol, used by Linksys WVC200 for example.
 *     This implementation has been made by reverse-engineering
 *     the protocol, so it may contain bugs and should be considered as
 *     experimental.
 *
 * Protocol explanation:
 *
 *     The stream consists of JPG pictures, spanned across multiple
 *     MJPG chunks (in general 3 chunks, altough that's not guaranteed).
 *
 *     Each data chunk can range from 1 to 65535 bytes + a header, altough
 *     i have not seen anything bigger than 20000 bytes + a header.
 *
 *     One MJPG chunk is constituted by a header plus the chunk data.
 *     The chunk header is of fixed size, and the following data size
 *     and position in the frame is specified in the chunk header.
 *
 *     From what i have seen on WVC200 cameras, the stream always begins
 *     on JPG frame boundary, so you don't have to worry about beginning
 *     in the middle of a frame.
 *
 *     See netcam.h for the mjpg_header structure and more details.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *      netcam          Pointer to a netcam_context structure
 *
 * Returns:             0 if an image was obtained from the camera,
 *                      or -1 if an error occurred.
